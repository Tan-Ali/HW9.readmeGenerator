# Good README Generator

## Description 
This weeks homework was to create a command-lind application that dynamixally generates a README.md from a user's input.  The application would generate the following sections:

`

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions

`

While doing the homework we used fs, which is used to write and read files.  We also used Node Package Manager (npm) which links the variable to the main js file.  Once the package is installed the user will run the application.  The user will then be presented with a number of prompts used to help create the README.md file for the user.

## Example of Usage
